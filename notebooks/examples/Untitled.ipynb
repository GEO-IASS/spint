    "Spatial interaction modeling involves the analysis of flows from an origin to a destination either over physical space (i.e., migration) or through abstract space (i.e., telecommunication). Despite being a fundamental technique to regional science (citation), there is relatively little software available to carry out spatial interaction modeling and the analysis of flow data. Therefore, the purpose of this primer is to provide an overview of the recently develped spatial interaction modeling (SpInt) module of the python spatial analysis library (PySAL). First, the current framework of the module will be highlighted. Next, the main functionality of the module will be illustrated with a common regional science example, migration flows, with a dataset previously used for spatial interaction modeling tutorials in the R programming environment. Finally, some auxilliary functionality and future additions are discussed. "

    "The core purpose of the SpInt module is to provide the functionality to calibrate spatial interaction models. Since the \"family\" of spatial interaction models put forth by Wilson (Wilson, 1971) are perhaps the most popular, they were chosen as the starting point of the module.

Of note is that the unconstrained model with of power function distance-decay is equivalent to the basic gravity model in equation (2), except that the scaling factor, $k$, is not included.

    "The family provides different model strucutre depedning on the available data or the research question at hand. The so-called unconstrained model does not conserve the total inflows or outflows during parameter estimation. The production-constrained and attraction-constrained models conserve either the number of total inflows or outflows, respectively, and are therefore useful for building models that allocate flows either to a set of origins or to a set of destinations. Finally, the doubly-constrained model conserves both the inflows and the outflows at each location during model calibration. The quantity of explanatory information provided by each model is given by the number of parameters it provides. As such, the unconstrained model provides the most information, followed by the two singly-constrained models, with the doubly-constrained model providing the least information. Conversely, the model's predictive power increases with higher quantities of built-in information (i.e. total in or out-flows) so that the doubly-constrained model usually provides the most accurate predictions, followed by the two singly-constrained models, and the unconstrained model supplying the weakest predictions (Fotheringham & O'Kelly, 1989).

    "A generalized linear model (GLM) approach will be adopted for modeling counts, so developing this framework would be the first outcome of this project, which could be used more widely throuhgout PySAL. While this functionality currently exists in another python library (statsmodels), the newly developed GLM framework would a) accommodate a sparse data structure often utilized in PySAL's spatial regression module and b) be light-weight so it would be simple to extend for various models with spatial effects. The other major outcome of this project would be a comprehensive module focused on spatial interaction modeling, which would include exploratory statistics, data structures, and models, as well as documentation and educational materials. In terms of exploratory statistics, the module will consist of tests of overdispersion and spatial dependence to detect potential problems when modeling counts of flows. New data structures will include origin-destination weights and network-based weights, which are needed to capture spatial dependence in flows. Finally, the Poisson GLM framework will be extended to include models that account for overdisperison or spatial dependence. The final module could exist within the core of PySAL or as a contributor module, depending on which dependencies are necessary. "
